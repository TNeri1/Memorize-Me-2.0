# Memorize Me 2.0

## Overview

I really wanted to dive into Android app development having already experimented making an iOS app in XCode using Swift (Project TapTap: Different Repository).
I wanted to expand my capabilities as a software engineer and use Android Studio and Kotlin to develop an idea I had for a while now--Memorize Me. 

We are all familiar with apps like Quizlet, Kahoot, or Chegg. What I don't like about those apps is that there is so much bells and whistles that come with them when all I want to do is make simple flash cards that I can write down what I want to memorize. This app accomplishes a more simplistic approach in helping to make memorizing any topic I am studying much easier.

Using it is very self-explanatory:
- Press the plus button to add a flash card
- Press the triple dot button to delete or edit the currently selected card
- Swipe Left and Right to navigate to the card you want

I really devloped this with two goals in mind:
* I want this app to be something I could use and continue to develop as I progressively use it.
* I also want this app to be something that my fellow classmates can use. (Who knows, I might publish this on the Google PlayStore)
